# A-search-Algorithm-implementation
A* Search algorithm is one of the best and most popular techniques used in path-finding and graph traversals.

### Files
    Astar.py
### Input
    heuristic, graph nodes
### Output
    if the path exists "Path found: {}" path nodes will be in the curly 
    brackets, "with total cost" and the least path cost to reach the goal 
    state 
    if the path does not exist "Path does not exist!"
